DevOps guy working for GE in the AWS/Azure Cloud space as an Operations Manager. 

# Background
I have a background as a SysAdmin and network administrator that transitioned into a DevOps role managing infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines for a marketing company.

From there I transitioned to managing operations for a cloud governance product for GE internal customers.

# Focus
Today my focus is on building systems of scale for a bunch of customers and cloud engineers. This includes topics such as:
* Inventory management
* Compliance automation
* IAM and RBAC models for accessing shared services
* Product based operational workflows 

All of this requires an understanding cloud infrastructure, data flows, and API development so that tooling can be created to manage all of it. 

# Interests
I'm into house projects, food, and travel for the most part. I love cars and old trucks but I don't have time to work on any of them anymore. I've also been pretty into [Utopia Game](https://utopia-game.com/) recently.
