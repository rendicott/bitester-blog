I'm a technologist working with AWS/Azure in the Enterprise Cloud space that's performaed several roles such as operations engineer, operations manager, architect, and architecture manager. 

# Background
I have a background as a sysadmin and network administrator that transitioned into a devops role managing infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines for a marketing company.

From there I transitioned to managing operations for a cloud governance product for a large company's internal business unit customers. Eventually I went on to do Solution Architecture within one of those internal businesses. The company then changed it's overall structure and will be going through a very complex transformation for a few years so now I've left to do something similar at another large company who is earlier on in their cloud journey.  

# Focus
Today my focus is on building systems of scale for a bunch of customers and cloud engineers. This includes topics such as:
* Inventory and Account management
* Compliance automation
* IAM and RBAC models for accessing shared services
* Product based operational workflows 
* Infrastructure Patterns
* Project Management
* Service Team to Product Team Transformation

All of this requires an understanding cloud infrastructure, data flows, API's, organizations, and people so that tooling and processes can be created to manage all of it. 

# Interests
I'm into house projects, food, backpacking, and travel for the most part. I love cars and old trucks but I don't have much time to work on any of them anymore.
